# Designing Machine Learning Systems

*Chip Huyen* | 11 chapters | O'Reilly, 2022

## About

A holistic guide to designing ML systems that are reliable, scalable, maintainable, and adaptive. Covers each design decision — data processing, feature engineering, model selection, deployment, monitoring — in the context of how it helps the system as a whole achieve its objectives. Based on the author's Stanford course CS 329S: Machine Learning Systems Design.

## Key Takeaway

ML in production is fundamentally a systems problem, not a modelling problem. The gap between what works in research and what works in production comes down to data quality, feature engineering, deployment infrastructure, and continuous monitoring — not algorithm choice.
