# Chapter 1: Strategic Thinking

### Main Idea

We are far better at **execution** (how to achieve goals) than **strategy** (what goals to pursue). We devote ~95% of effort to doing things and ~5% to questioning whether they're the right things. This imbalance leads to exhausting ourselves in pursuit of the wrong destinations.

### Why It Happens

Evolutionarily, strategy was obvious (survive, eat, reproduce) — all the challenge lay in execution. Modern life demands we choose our own purpose, but nothing in our education or culture prepares us for this. Raising strategic questions ("What is a good holiday?", "Why do we want money?") feels pretentious or absurd.

### Notable Example

**The monastery as a thinking machine.** St Benedict's 5th-century monastic rules — sparse diet, silence, shorn hair, no gossip, physical labour between reflection periods — were essentially a system designed to eliminate distraction and support deep strategic thought. The author proposes modern equivalents: office uniforms, internet bans, architecture with cells instead of open-plan offices. "To think more effectively, we need to build ourselves **monasteries of the mind**."

### Mental Manoeuvre

Shift from 95/5 to at least 80/20 execution-to-strategy ratio. Grow suspicious of busyness as a substitute for reflection. Redefine "hard work" — it might be the person gazing out the window with a notebook, not the one sprinting between meetings.
