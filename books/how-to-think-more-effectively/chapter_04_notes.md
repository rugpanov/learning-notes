# Chapter 4: Independent Thinking

### Main Idea
We are trained to believe that valuable ideas must come from **outside us** — from books, authorities, people with prestigious names. This creates excessive intellectual submission and leaves vast inner riches untapped. The genius doesn't have different thoughts from the rest of us; they simply **take their own thoughts more seriously**.

### Why It Happens
Education rewards submission to authority and punishes originality. The safest way to be taken seriously is to footnote someone famous rather than trust your own perception. We kill off promising thoughts for fear of seeming strange.

### Notable Examples
- **Montaigne's arse.** Michel de Montaigne mocked scholars who couldn't share a personal observation without first consulting a book: "He would not venture to tell me that he has scabs on his arse without studying his lexicon to find out the meanings of scab and arse."
- **The Leopard's dance scene.** A passage from Lampedusa's novel — widely praised as literary brilliance — describes a newly engaged couple dancing, mortal and naive, "trying to brighten the brief passage between birth and death." The author's point: nothing in this paragraph contains a truth we didn't already know. We stayed silent not because we lacked the insight, but because we lacked the **courage**.
- **Emerson's line:** "In the minds of geniuses, we find — once more — our own neglected thoughts."
- **Michelangelo:** "The statue is already in the stone; my work is to liberate it." Our great thoughts are already in our heads — we need to liberate them from our own hesitancy.

### Mental Manoeuvre
Put aside external authorities. Ask yourself what *you* think. Stay faithful to what you've felt. Children are more interesting than average adults because they haven't yet become experts in what *not* to say or think.
