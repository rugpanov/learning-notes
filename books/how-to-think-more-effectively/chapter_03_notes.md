# Chapter 3: Butterfly Thinking

### Main Idea
The most important thoughts are the most likely to **escape us**. There is a devilish correlation between how crucial a thought is and how readily it eludes our grasp — because important new ideas generate anxiety. They threaten the status quo: they might mean leaving a job, ending a relationship, rethinking our identity.

### Why It Happens
One part of us *wants* the thought to escape so we don't have to face discomfort. The mind censors its own best insights as a defence mechanism. Demanding we "think harder" is counterproductive — we need to lower the mind's guard through gentle distraction.

### Notable Examples
- **Plato's birdcage.** The mind is a cage full of birds (ideas) racing agitatedly about; we can only catch them when they briefly land on a perch.
- **Nabokov as lepidopterist.** Ideas are butterflies — the skilled thinker must lie patiently in wait with a net of awareness. (Nabokov was literally a butterfly collector.)
- **Virginia Woolf on Proust:** "He searches out these butterfly shades to the last grain. He is as tough as catgut & as evanescent as a butterfly's bloom."

### Mental Manoeuvre
The **shower** as thinking sanctuary. The mind isn't "meant to be thinking" there — it's occupied with soaping and rinsing — so the deeper, bolder thoughts can finally slip through. The same applies to long train journeys, solitary walks, driving on the highway. The best thinking happens when the anxious, managerial surface of the mind is gently occupied with something else.
