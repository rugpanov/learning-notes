# Chapter 2: Cumulative Thinking

### Main Idea
The mind is an **intermittent instrument** — it produces ideas in dribs and drabs, not coherent bursts. One paragraph might take a morning; a book, three years. We mistake the polished final output of others for spontaneous brilliance and feel inadequate about our own messy process.

### Why It Matters
At any single moment, our thinking is shaped by what we've eaten, the time of day, what we've been reading, our relationships, even the season. We never have access to all our ideas at once. Good thinking requires **accumulation across moods and moments**.

### Notable Example
**Proust's manuscripts.** Marcel Proust reads as effortlessly fluent, but his notebooks reveal dense layers of changes, crossed-out sections, side notes, revisions spanning years. The polished voice was assembled painstakingly, not spontaneously generated. "The Proust we read is an artificial voice assembled over years."

### Mental Manoeuvre
The essential tool: **a notebook**. It serves as secondary memory, pooling together thoughts from different times and states of mind. An idea from Monday morning in November may find its logical counterpart only in January during a turbulent night. The notebook allows us to remeet ideas "cold" and refine them honestly across dozens of attempts.
