# How to Think More Effectively

*The School of Life* | 15 chapters

## About

A practical guide to improving the quality of our thoughts. The book argues that good thinking is not a mystical gift but a skill that can be cultivated through specific mental manoeuvres. It draws on philosophers (Socrates, Montaigne), writers (Proust, Woolf, Nabokov) and historical practices (Benedictine monasticism) to show how anxiety, vagueness, excessive deference to authority and chronic busyness sabotage our best ideas — and what to do about it.

## Key Takeaway

We already have the raw material for valuable insights. What we lack is the courage to take our own thoughts seriously, the patience to let them accumulate, and the discipline to refine them from vague impressions into precise, actionable ideas.
