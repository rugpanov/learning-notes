# Chapter 5: Focused Thinking

### Main Idea

Our minds produce thoughts that are **vague rather than wrong**. We say we want something "creative" or that dinner was "brilliant" — but these generalities lack the specificity needed to guide action. The difference between vagueness and focus is what separates great from mediocre thinking (and art).

### Why It Happens

There's no internal alarm system for vagueness. We feel our thoughts are clear, but under questioning they dissolve. Socrates demonstrated this in Athens — confident citizens claimed to care about "justice" or "courage" but couldn't define what they meant when pressed.

### Notable Examples

- **Socrates in the marketplace.** He didn't disagree with people — he simply asked them to define their terms. After a few minutes of questioning, it always emerged they couldn't say clearly what they meant by the big words they relied on.
- **Proust vs his friend's cliché moon.** Gabriel de la Rochefoucauld wrote that "the moon shines discreetly." Proust pointed out the cliché, then wrote his own moon: "a white moon would creep up like a little cloud, furtive, without display, suggesting an actress who does not have to 'come on' for a while, and so goes 'in front' in her ordinary clothes to watch the rest of the company." Clichés aren't false — they're **superficial articulations of very good ideas**.

### Mental Manoeuvre

Chip away at vagueness with pointed questions: *What do you really mean? What is this unlike? When have you felt this before? How might you put this in different terms?* Start with ore; end with refined metal. Start with a block of stone; end with a sculpture.
